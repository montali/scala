# scala

Yo! Welcome here, I'll use this repo to note down some concepts and maybe a little bit of code to better understand this bad boi.

## Evaluation of expressions

Expressions are evaluated by taking the leftmost operator, evaluating its operands, then apply it. Note that methods with no parameters **can be called without the `()`**. The **infix notation** is what allow you to transform a `1.to(10)` to a `1 to 10`. It's what we do with arithmetic operands, for instance: `1 + 3` would actually be `1.+(3)` in a cruel world. Types in Scala start with an uppercase letter.
Remember that `def` are evaluated each time they're used, while `val`s are only evaluated when instantiated. Functions need an explicit return type when recursive.
For example, a function defined as follows:

```scala
def stringOfSum(x: Int, y: Int): String = (x + y).toString
```

would have arguments of type `Int` and return type `String`.
Scala uses **call-by-value**: this means that when you call a method, first its arguments are evaluated, then the right-hand side substitution is applied. The alternative is **call-by-name**, which evaluates the functions to unreduced arguments. Both strategies reduce to the same final values as long as the reduced expression consists of pure functions, and both of them terminate.

## Lexical scopes

Inner functions are a thing in Scala: for example, if we wanted to define a `sqrt` function, it would be good to only keep the involved functions in its scope:

```scala
def sqrt(x: Double) = {
  def sqrtIter(guess: Double, x: Double): Double =
    if (isGoodEnough(guess, x)) guess
    else sqrtIter(improve(guess, x), x)

  def improve(guess: Double, x: Double) =
    (guess + x / guess) / 2

  def isGoodEnough(guess: Double, x: Double) =
    abs(square(guess) - x) < 0.001

  sqrtIter(1.0, x)
}
```

Note the use of **blocks**: the braces `{}` delimit a block, an element containing a sequence of definitions or expressions, and lastly, the desired value for the block. The block is an example of reduced scope: what you create inside the block stays there, and if you define something having the same name as something outside of it, it will **shadow** it.
Note that semicolons work in Scala, but they're optional if you just go to a new line. If you need to have a multi-line expression, you can use parenthesis `()` or just end the line with an operator.
You can organize your shit in **objects**:

```scala
object Maths {
    def sqrt ...
    val x ...
}
```

and **packages**, referenced through `package/object.scala`:

```scala
package shit
object Maths { ... }
```

Note that definitions in a package are visible from other definitions of the same package. All the members of the classes `scala`, `java.lang`, `scala.Predef` are imported automatically.

## Tail recursion

Tail recursion is a concept crucial for performance of recursion. Basically, when a function is tail recursive, the stack frame is recycled across the several executions. This implies that the function can execute in constant stack space, so it's computationally similar to a loop. When is a function **tail recursive**, though? It is if and only if the last action of the function is the recursive call. For example,

```scala
def gcd(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
  if (b == 0) a else gcd(b, a % b)
```

is tail recursive, as `gcd(b, a % b)` is the last action. Contrarily,

```scala
def factorial(n: Int): Int =
  if (n == 0) 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)
```

is not, as the last action is `n * factorial(n - 1)`, involing a product and not the pure call.
One can require a function to be tail recursive by using the `@tailrec` annotation.
If we wanted to make `factorial` tail recursive, we could introduce an _accumulator_ as follows:

```scala
def factorial(n:Int) : Int = {
    @tailrec
    def factorial(n: Int, accumulator: Int) =
        if (n==0) accumulator else factorial(n-1, accumulator*n)
    factorial(n, 1)
}
```

Remember to import `scala.annotation.tailrec` if you want to use that annotation.

## Structuring informations

**Case classes** allow us to gather together coherent informations. For example, if we wanted to define a `Car` type, we could do so with a `case class`:

```scala
case class Car (
    make: String,
    model: String,
    horsepower: Int
)
val my_car = Car("Honda", "Civic", 129)
```

You can then access the fields with a dot: `my_car.make shouldBe "Honda"`.
If we wanted to make things more abstract, we could want to add a `Vehicle` type. This might represent, for example, a car or a motorbike. To do so, Scala features **sealed traits**, an abstract concept that can be embodied by something more concrete:

```scala
sealed trait Vehicle
case class Car (...) extends Vehicle
case class Motorbike (...) extends Vehicle
```

Now, if we wanted to have a method `goFast(vehicle: Vehicle)` we'd need to specify how to go fast on a motorbike and on a car. Which are different things. **Pattern matching** serves this purpose: it allows us to match the selector with the patterns, than substitutes the right-hand side of it.

```scala
def goFast(vehicle: Vehicle) = vehicle match {
    case Car(make, model, horsepower) => pedalToMetal(horsepower)
    case Motorbike(model, horsepower) => squidAway(horsepower)
}
```

When we're matching against a sealed trait, the compiler will check that the matching is exhaustive. Note that comparing case classes is equal to comparing the single values in them. Note that _case objects_ exist too, and we can use them, for example, as enums:

```scala
sealed trait CarMake
case object Honda extends CarMake
case object Mercedes extends CarMake
case object Audi extends CarMake
â€¦
case object BMW extends CarMake
```

### Difference between traits and case classes

You can imagine this difference to be the one from the _have_ and the _is_ verbs. If something **is** something, it will be a sealed trait. If something **has** something, it will be a case class.

## Higher order functions

Scala is a functional language: a function can be passed as any other value!
Functions that take other functions as parameters or that return functions are called **higher order functions**. If we wanted to define a function that accumulates an array through a function, for example to compute factorials, we could do that as follows:

```scala
def sum(f: Int => Int, a: Int, b: Int): Int =
  if (a > b) 0
  else f(a) + sum(f, a + 1, b)
```

then use it with the above-defined `factorial()`:

```scala
def sumFactorials(a: Int, b: Int) = sum(factorial, a, b)
```

Note that the type of the argument `f` is `Int => Int`, meaning a function that takes `Int` as the only argument and outputs an `Int`. You can have multi-parameter functions with `(Int, Int) => Int`.
Scala provides **anonymous functions** too: sometimes you don't need to name a function only to use it one time.
If we wanted to use the mentioned `sum` function to sum cubes, we could just do:

```scala
def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int) = sum(x => x*x, a, b)
```
